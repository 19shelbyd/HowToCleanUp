<h1> How To Do A Leap </h1>


<h2> Step 1</h2>
<p style="color:#ffffff"> The first part of doing a leap is stretching. The legs are the main part.
<br> The hamstrings need to be completely stretched out so a muscle is not pulled. The calves and hips also need to be warmed up. 
</p>
<!--This is step 2 -->
<h3> Step 2</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff"> 
Once the legs are warmed up the next part is jumping. A leap is where the legs separte into a split position in the air. The body is glided through the air.
<br> The legs need to be totally straight and the ankles and toes need to be stretched. 
<br> The front leg will have a kicking action to get it into the air, and the back leg pushes off the ground and pulls back to make a split postion in the air. 
</p>
<!--This is step 3 -->
<h3> Step 3</h3>
<p style="color:#ffffff"> The arms also have something to do. One arm will go in front of the face using energy to pull it out. The other arm goes out to the side. 
<br> The head is also lifted, and it is looking over the front arm. The shoulders need to be pushed dowm, and the neck is long.

<p> In the end doing a leap is difficult. The legs and arms need to work together; they need to be stretched. Every part of the body has something to do.
